My Project Name
==============================

This is a Django Project


LICENSE: BSD


Getting up and running
----------------------

The steps below will get you up and running with a local development environment. We assume you have the following installed:

* pip
* virtualenv
* PostgreSQL

First make sure to create and activate a virtualenv_, then open a terminal at the project root and install the requirements for local development::

    $ pip install -r requirements/local.txt

.. _virtualenv: http://docs.python-guide.org/en/latest/dev/virtualenvs/

You can now run the usual Django ``runserver`` command (replace ``yourapp`` with the name of the directory containing the Django project)::

    $ python my_app/manage.py runserver


**Live reloading and Sass CSS compilation**

If you'd like to take advantage of live reloading and Sass / Compass CSS compilation you can do so with the included Grunt task.

Make sure that nodejs_ is installed. Then in the project root run::

    $ npm install grunt

.. _nodejs: http://nodejs.org/download/

Now you just need::

    $ grunt serve

The base app will now run as it would with the usual ``manage.py runserver`` but with live reloading and Sass compilation enabled.

To get live reloading to work you'll probably need to install an `appropriate browser extension`_

It's time to write the code!!!
